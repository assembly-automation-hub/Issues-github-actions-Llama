## Features
* **Automated Diff Analysis:** Extracts and parses code patches from Git pushes and Pull Requests.
* **Intelligent Labeling:** Automatically assigns relevant tags (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `security`) based on context.
* **Security Auditing:** Scans patches for hardcoded secrets, injection flaws, and XSS vulnerabilities, appending a `Security Warning` to the issue body.
* **Dual Trigger Support:** Seamlessly handles both standard branch pushes and PR synchronization events without duplicating issues.
* **Zero-Cost Operation:** Leverages Google's Gemini API free tier limits, removing the need for expensive OpenAI token billing.
* **Identity Verification:** Executes workflows exclusively for the designated repository owner to prevent unauthorized API usage.

## Tech Stack & Architecture
* **Language:** Python 3.11
* **Orchestration:** GitHub Actions (IssueOps pattern)
* **Libraries:** `PyGithub` (for GitHub REST API interactions), `requests` (for direct Google API communication)
* **LLM Provider:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash` model)

### Project Structure & Key Design Decisions
The architecture follows a decoupled IssueOps model. The `.yml` file handles environment provisioning and CI/CD triggers, while the state-agnostic Python script manages logic.
* `.github/workflows/ai-issue.yml`: CI/CD pipeline definition. Injects secrets as environment variables.
* `process_event.py`: Core logic runner. Uses direct HTTP POST requests to the Gemini endpoint to bypass dependency conflicts inherent in Google SDKs within Ubuntu runner environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* A GitHub repository with GitHub Actions enabled.
* A Google AI Studio API key.

### Installation
1. Clone your repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/OstinUA/your-repo.git](https://github.com/OstinUA/your-repo.git)
   cd your-repo

```

2. Create the GitHub Action workflow file `.github/workflows/ai-issue.yml` and paste the provided YAML configuration.
3. Create `process_event.py` in the root directory and paste the provided Python script.
4. Commit and push the files to your `main` branch:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: setup gemini auto-issue generator"
git push origin main

```



## Testing

To test the integration locally or trigger a dry-run:

1. Create a dummy branch: `git checkout -b test-ai-action`
2. Introduce a deliberate flaw (e.g., `const API_KEY = "12345";`).
3. Push the branch and open a Pull Request to `main`.
4. Monitor the Actions tab to verify successful execution and issue generation.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled automatically via GitHub Actions upon pushing the `.yml` configuration to the default branch. Ensure that repository workflow permissions are set to `Read and write permissions`.

## Usage

The system operates autonomously in the background.

* **For Pushes:** Push commits directly to `main`. An issue will be generated documenting the changes.
* **For PRs:** Open or synchronize a Pull Request. The action will analyze the entire PR diff and generate a summary issue.

## Configuration

Configure the following Repository Secrets via `Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions`:

* `GH_MODELS_TOKEN`: Your generated API key: https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens.
* `ALLOWED_USER`: Your exact GitHub handle (e.g., `OstinUA`).
